# Password-Creator


## Description
I was tasked with adding several different stages and ways to interact with the starter code that was given to us. This will now accurately prompt you with different options for a passowrd such as its length, uppercase/lowercase characters and if you would like to add numbers or special characters as well. This will give you a generated password between 8 - 128 characters.
